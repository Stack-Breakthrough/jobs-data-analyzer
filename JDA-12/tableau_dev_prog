You should read the full agreement above, but a few things we want to point out about your new sandbox:

Your site may be updated at any time and content could be wiped or lost. Always back up what youâ€™re working on.
Your site is not intended for heavy workloads. If your site negatively impacts other developer sites, we may throttle or remove it.
Examples for the types of activities you should use the Tableau Cloud development site for include:

Testing and evaluating new or updated Tableau APIs*
Build and test Dashboard Extensions that you can deploy internally or share via the Tableau Exchange
Build and test new embedded deployments of Tableau
Test automation scripts that use Tableau REST APIs or tabcmd
Create new workflows for Tableau using webhooks
